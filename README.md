2) The correct letters are turned to Green, correct but wrong position to Yellow and incorrect to Gray.
3) A clickable keyboard and an official wordlist is used to make each word random to guess on refreshing the page.
4) Allows to backspace and try again if answer hasn't been submitted.

Area of Improvement/help I need:- 
As you can see from the output , the letter "S" in the keyboard turned grey despite it being in the word itself , due to my attempt of trying it twice in the word "BUSES" . I am unable to figure out the code for this currently , but will update / edit it when I do.
